# Module 3 - Dapr Integration with ACA

In this module, we will start integrating Dapr into both services and see how Dapr with ACA will simplify complex microservices scenarios such as service discovery, service-to-service invocation, calling services asynchronously via pub/sub patterns, auto-scaling for overloaded services, etc..

### Benefits of integrating Dapr in Azure Container Apps
The Tasks Tracker microservice application is composed of multiple microservices (2 microservices so far), and function calls are spread across the network. To support the distributed nature of microservices, we need to account for failures, retries, and timeouts. While Container Apps features the building blocks for running microservices, the use of Dapr provides an even richer microservices programming model. Dapr includes features like service discovery, pub/sub, service-to-service invocation with mutual TLS, retries, state store management, and more.

### Configure Dapr on a local development machine
In order to run applications using Dapr, we need to install and initialize Dapr CLI locally. The official documentation is quite clear and we can follow the steps needed to [install](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) Dapr and then [Initialize](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/) it.

### Run Backend API and Frontend Web App locally using Dapr
When we complete the previous step, we are ready to run the applications locally using Dapr sidecar in a self-hosted mode. There is a VS code extension named [Dapr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-dapr) which will help us to run, debug, and interact with Dapr-enabled applications in VS Code.

1. Now we are ready to run the Backend Web API using Dapr, from VS Code open a new PowerShell terminal, change the directory in the terminal to folder `TasksTracker.TasksManager.Backend.Api` and run the below command in PS terminal:

    ```powershell
    dapr run --app-id tasksmanager-backend-api --app-port 7088 --dapr-http-port 3500 --app-ssl dotnet run
    ```
    When using Dapr run command we are running a dapr process as a sidecar next to the Web API application, the properties we have configured as the following:
    * app-id: The unique identifier of the application. Used for service discovery, state encapsulation, and the pub/sub consumer identifier.
    * app-port: This parameter tells Dapr which port your application is listening on, you can get the app port from `launchSettings.json` file in the Web API Project.
    * dapr-http-port: The HTTP port for Dapr to listen on.
    * app-ssl: Sets the URI scheme of the app to https and attempts an SSL connection.
    For a full list of properties, you can check this [link.](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-run/)

    If all is working as expected, you should receive an output similar to the below where your app logs and dapr logs will appear on the same PowerShell terminal:
    ![dapr-logs](../../assets/images/03-aca-dapr-integration/dapr-logs.jpg)

    Now to test invoking the Web API using Dapr sidecar, you can issue HTTP GET request to the following URL: `http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/tasksmanager-backend-api/method/api/tasks?createdBy=user@mail.com`

    What happened here is that Dapr exposes its HTTP and gRPC APIs as a sidecar process, as a process that can access our Backend Web API, we didn't do any changes to the application code to include any Dapr runtime code as well providing separation of the application logic for improved supportability.

    Looking back at the HTTP GET request, we can break it into the following:

    * `/v1.0/invoke` Endpoint: is the Dapr feature identifier for the "Service to Service invocation" building block. This building block enables applications to communicate with each other through well-known endpoints in the form of http or gRPC messages. Dapr provides an endpoint that acts as a combination of a reverse proxy with built-in service discovery while leveraging built-in distributed tracing and error handling.
    * `3500`: the HTTP port that Dapr is listening on.
    * `tasksmanager-backend-api`: is the dapr application unique identifier.
    * `method`: reserved word when using invoke endpoint.
    * `api/tasks?createdBy=user@mail.com`: the path of the action method that needs to be invoked in the remote service.

    Another example is that we want to create a new task by invoking the POST operation, we need to issue the below POST request:

    ```http
    POST /v1.0/invoke/tasksmanager-backend-api/method/api/tasks/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3500
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
            "taskName": "Task number: 51",
            "taskCreatedBy": "user@mail.com",
            "taskDueDate": "2022-08-31T09:33:35.9256429Z",
            "taskAssignedTo": "user2@mail.com"
    }
    ```
2. Next, we will be using Dapr SDK in the frontend Web App to invoke Backend API services, The [Dapr .NET SDK](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk) provides .NET developers with an intuitive and language-specific way to interact with Dapr. The SDK offers developers three ways of making remote service invocation calls:
    1. Invoke HTTP services using HttpClient
    2. Invoke HTTP services using DaprClient
    3. Invoke gRPC services using DaprClient

    In the implementation shared in GitHub source code, I'm using the second approach (HTTP services using DaprClient), but it is worth describing the first approach (Invoke HTTP services using HttpClient) in the post here. So I will go over the first approach briefly and then discuss the second one too.

    Now we will install DAPR SDK for .NET Core in the Frontend Web APP so use the service discovery and service invocation offered by Dapr Sidecar, to do so, open the .csproj file of the project `TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui.csproj` and add the below NuGet package

    ```json
    <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Dapr.AspNetCore" Version="1.9.0" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```
    Next, open the file `Programs.cs` of the Frontend Web App and register the DaprClient as the code below. 
    The `AddDaprClient` call registers the `DaprClient` class with the ASP.NET Core dependency injection system. With the client registered, you can now inject an instance of DaprClient into your service code to communicate with the Dapr sidecar, building blocks, and components.

    ```csharp
    namespace TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui
    {
        public class Program
        {
            public static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
                // Add services to the container.
                builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
                // Code removed for brevity 	
                builder.Services.AddDaprClient();
                var app = builder.Build();
                // Code removed for brevity 
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Now, we will inject the DaprClient into the Index.cshtml page to use the method `InvokeMethodAsync` (second approach), to do so, open the page named `Index.cshtml.cs` under folder `Pages\Tasks` and use the code below
    ```csharp
    namespace TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui.Pages.Tasks
    {
        public class IndexModel : PageModel
        {

            private readonly IHttpClientFactory _httpClientFactory;
            private readonly DaprClient _daprClient;
            public List<TaskModel>? TasksList { get; set; }

            [BindProperty]
            public string? TasksCreatedBy { get; set; }

            public IndexModel(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, DaprClient daprClient)
            {
                _httpClientFactory = httpClientFactory;
                _daprClient = daprClient;
            }

            public async Task OnGetAsync()
            {
            
                TasksCreatedBy = Request.Cookies["TasksCreatedByCookie"];

                //Invoke via internal URL (Not Dapr)
                //var httpClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("BackEndApiExternal");
                //TasksList = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<TaskModel>>($"api/tasks?createdBy={TasksCreatedBy}");


                // Invoke via Dapr SideCar URL
                //var port = 3500;//Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DAPR_HTTP_PORT");
                //HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
                //var result = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<List<TaskModel>>($"http://localhost:{port}/v1.0/invoke/tasksmanager-backend-api/method/api/tasks?createdBy={TasksCreatedBy}");
                //TasksList = result;

                // Invoke via DaprSDK (Invoke HTTP services using HttpClient) --> Use Dapr Desitination App ID (Option 1)
                //var daprHttpClient = DaprClient.CreateInvokeHttpClient(appId: "tasksmanager-backend-api"); 
                //TasksList = await daprHttpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<TaskModel>>($"api/tasks?createdBy={TasksCreatedBy}");
                
                // Invoke via DaprSDK (Invoke HTTP services using HttpClient) --> Specify Port (Option 2)
                //var daprHttpClient = DaprClient.CreateInvokeHttpClient(daprEndpoint: "http://localhost:3500"); 
                //TasksList = await daprHttpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<TaskModel>>($"http://tasksmanager-backend-api/api/tasks?createdBy={TasksCreatedBy}");
                
                // Invoke via DaprSDK (Invoke HTTP services using DaprClient)
                TasksList = await _daprClient.InvokeMethodAsync<List<TaskModel>>(HttpMethod.Get, "tasksmanager-backend-api", $"api/tasks?createdBy={TasksCreatedBy}");

            }

            public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostDeleteAsync(Guid id)
            {
                // direct svc to svc http request
                // var httpClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("BackEndApiExternal");
                // var result = await httpClient.DeleteAsync($"api/tasks/{id}");

                //Dapr SideCar Invocation
                await _daprClient.InvokeMethodAsync(HttpMethod.Delete, "tasksmanager-backend-api", $"api/tasks/{id}");

                return RedirectToPage();          
            }

            public async Task<IActionResult> OnPostCompleteAsync(Guid id)
            {
                // direct svc to svc http request
                // var httpClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient("BackEndApiExternal");
                // var result = await httpClient.PutAsync($"api/tasks/{id}/markcomplete", null);

                //Dapr SideCar Invocation
                await _daprClient.InvokeMethodAsync(HttpMethod.Put, "tasksmanager-backend-api", $"api/tasks/{id}/markcomplete");

                return RedirectToPage();
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Notice how we are not using the `HttpClientFactory` anymore and how we were able from the Frontend Dapr Sidecar to invoke backend API Sidecar using the method `InvokeMethodAsync` which accepts the Dapr **remote App ID** for the Backend API `tasksmanager-backend-api` and it will be able to discover the URL and invoke the method based on the specified input params.

    In addition to this, notice how in POST and PUT operations, the third argument is a `TaskAdd` or `TaskUpdate` Model, those objects will be serialized internally (using System.Text.JsonSerializer) and sent as the request payload. The .NET SDK takes care of the call to the Sidecar. It also deserializes the response in case of the GET operations to a `List<TaskModel>` object.

    Looking at the first option of invoking the remote service "Invoke HTTP services using HttpClient", you can see that we can create an HttpClient by invoking `DaprClient.CreateInvokeHttpClient` and specify the remote service app id, custom port if needed and then use the HTTP methods such as `GetFromJsonAsync`, this is a good approach as well at it gives you full support of advanced scenarios, such as custom headers, and full control over request and response messages.

    In both options, the final request will be rewritten by the Dapr .NET SDK before it gets executed, in our case and for the GET operation it will be written to this request: `http://127.0.0.1:3500/v1/invoke/tasksmanager-backend-api/method/api/tasks?createdBy=user@mail.com`

    We need now to update the [Create.cshtml.cs](https://github.com/Azure/aca-dotnet-workshop/blob/5dc6b68dcf118440df4c96c14dd538d4d69f80f4/TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui/Pages/Tasks/Create.cshtml.cs) and [Edit.cshtml.cs](https://github.com/Azure/aca-dotnet-workshop/blob/5dc6b68dcf118440df4c96c14dd538d4d69f80f4/TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui/Pages/Tasks/Edit.cshtml.cs) by injecting the DaprClient. I will not copy the code here, but you can take a look at how the files will look after the update using the previous links.

3. We are ready now to verify changes on Frontend Web App and test locally, we need to run the Frontend Web App along with the Backend Web API and test locally that changes using the .NET SDK and invoking services via Dapr Sidecar are working as expected, to do so run the below 2 commands (Ensure that you are on the right project directory when running each command):

    ```powershell
    ~\TasksTracker.ContainerApps\TasksTracker.WebPortal.Frontend.Ui> dapr run --app-id tasksmanager-frontend-webapp --app-port 7208 --dapr-http-port 3501 --app-ssl dotnet run 

    ~\TasksTracker.ContainerApps\TasksTracker.TasksManager.Backend.Api> dapr run --app-id tasksmanager-backend-api --app-port 7088 --dapr-http-port 3500 --app-ssl dotnet run
    ```

    Notice how we assigned the Dapr App Id “tasksmanager-frontend-webapp” to the Frontend WebApp.

    Now both Applications are running using Dapr sidecar, open your browser and browser for "https://localhost:{localwebappport}", in my case it will be "https://localhost:7208" and provide an email to load the tasks for the user, if all is good you should see tasks list results.

**Note:** If we need to run both microservices together, we need to keep calling `dapr run` manually each time in the terminal, and when we have multiple microservices talking to each other and need to run at the same time to debug the solution, this will be a very annoying process. You can refer to the [debug and launch Dapr applications in VSCode](../../aca/20-appendix/01-run-debug-dapr-app-vscode.md) to see how configure VScode for running and debugging Dapr applications.

In the next module, we will integrate the Dapr state store building block by saving tasks to Azure Cosmos DB, and deploy the updated applications to Azure Container Apps.
